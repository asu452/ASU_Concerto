If you are running a 1.9.2 or an earlier version of Concerto, and would like to upgrade to Concerto 1.9.3 this may be of some help:
0.  Backup everything.  I make a habit of cp -R concerto ~/current_concerto just to make sure I don't loose anything.  A SQL dump wouldn't hurt either.
1.  Replace all your Concerto files with the new ones, obviously nothing in your content/images or content/templates directory 
    should get overridden, neither should your config.inc.php. 
2.  [ONLY IF YOU SKIPPED VERSION 1.9.2] Open up config.inc.php and delete any line that defines a VERSION.  This is stored in its own file so you don't have to
    manually update it anymore.
3.  [ONLY IF YOU SKIPPED VERSION 1.9.2] If you use Info Pages a lot (specifically the categories) and have been getting errors, you'll want to set "auto increment"
    on the id field of the "page_category" table.  You should probably backup your database first, and watch out for any
    categories with id=0.
4.  If you're using memcache or do any php caching, you should restart the appropriate services.
5.  Enjoy Concerto 1.9.3.  If you have any feedback, send it along!
